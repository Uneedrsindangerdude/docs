# Background Scrolling

Scrolls the background to make it look like it's going through.

Make a when green flag clicked block, then make a glide 1 seconds block: then use a forever loop and put the glide 30 seconds to block.

Great job! You made the background scroll! If it doesnt look like it, take the code from https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/946700968/
